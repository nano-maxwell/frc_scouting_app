<h1>FRC Scouting App</h1>
<h4>Last Updated: 3/9/25</h4>

A mobile app developed by members of FIRST Robotics team 3464 "Sim-City"

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<h3>Mission statement</h3><br>
Our app aims to provide in-depth statistics for FRC matches for teams to use during the season and to make scouting simple and fun for FIRST robotics participants and staff.
<h3>What problems does our app solve?</h3><br>
We have noticed and experienced the pain of scouting FRC matches, especially events in which our team is not competing. Watching matches is time-consuming, and it is often a waste of time to dedicate a team to detailing every match aspect during build or competition season. We make this process quick and simple for both contributors and useful for teams by providing access to an extensive, open database of information to plan their strategies and pick alliances in live events. Furthermore, we add fun while scouting through friendly competition between team scouters. 
Target Audience
We aim to provide our tools to all FIRST Robotics Competition enthusiasts, including but not limited to: students, mentors, team captains, FIRST staff, family and friends, and fans.
